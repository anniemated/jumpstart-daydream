My project is Jumpstart Daydream! It's a very basic platformer and it's called that because I submitted it for Jumpstart Daydream (Hack Club YSWS).
I made it with Godot and the one thing I drew (player char.) was done in Procreate. 
BTW to Athena staff I don't need artifacts for this, I'm just trying to log the various projects I've worked on over the summer.
